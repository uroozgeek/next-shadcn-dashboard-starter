## Architecture Decisions

1. [2025-04-08] **Feature-based Project Structure**
   - Decision: Implement feature-based organization pattern
   - Rationale: Improves code organization, maintainability, and scalability
   - Implementation: 
     - Features organized in dedicated directories
     - Each feature contains its components, actions, schemas, and utilities
     - Shared components and utilities in separate directories

2. [2025-04-08] **State Management Strategy**
   - Decision: Use Zustand for global state management
   - Rationale: Lightweight, flexible, and TypeScript-friendly
   - Implementation:
     - Local state with React hooks
     - Global state with Zustand stores
     - URL state with Nuqs for searchable/shareable states

3. [2025-04-08] **Authentication Implementation**
   - Decision: Implement Clerk for authentication
   - Rationale: Provides comprehensive auth features with minimal setup
   - Implementation:
     - Multiple auth methods support
     - Built-in user management
     - Enterprise SSO capabilities

4. [2025-04-08] **Data Table Implementation**
   - Decision: Use Tanstack Table with server-side operations
   - Rationale: Provides robust table features with performance optimization
   - Implementation:
     - Server-side searching
     - Server-side filtering
     - URL-based pagination state
     - Integration with Supabase queries

5. [2025-04-08] **Database Implementation**
   - Decision: Use Supabase as the database and backend service (excluding auth)
   - Rationale: Provides PostgreSQL database and real-time capabilities
   - Implementation:
     - PostgreSQL database for data storage
     - Real-time subscriptions for live updates
     - Row-level security integrated with Clerk authentication
     - Built-in API generation for data operations

[2025-04-08 19:42:00] - Updated to clarify separation between Clerk auth and Supabase database responsibilities

6. [2025-04-09] **Organization Management Implementation**
   - Decision: Use Clerk's organization management API for tenant switching
   - Rationale: 
     - Integrated with existing Clerk authentication
     - Built-in organization management features
     - Seamless multi-tenant support
   - Implementation:
     - Enhanced OrgSwitcher component with Clerk hooks
     - Organization context provider for app-wide state
     - Loading states and error handling
     - Data refresh patterns on organization switch
     - Access validation using Clerk's organization roles
